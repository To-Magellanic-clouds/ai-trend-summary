To translate the things we understand naturally (e.g. words, sounds, or videos) to a form that the algorithms can process, we often use embeddings, a mathematical vector representation that captures different facets (dimensions) of the data. In this interactive, you can explore multiple different algorithms (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) for exploring these embeddings in your browser.\\n\",\n",
